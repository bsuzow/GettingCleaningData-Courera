# Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repo is created for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera class for the Data Science Specialization. 
All files are downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Unzipping the archive creates a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset" to which all data files get dumped. For the context of the data, please refer to http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. 
Per the project instructions, only the mean and standard deviation features get extracted. The variables (features) whose names bear either "mean()" or "std()" satistfy this condition. Reference feature_info.txt which is available in the UCI HAR Dataset directory for details.
